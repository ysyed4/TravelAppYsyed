# SE 3316 - Lab 3/4
Please put all front-end files in the folder named `client` and all back-end files in the folder named `server`.

For lab 3, edit `client/index.html` file to add necessary HTML and add links to your CSS files. Add your front-end JavaScript code to `client/lab3.js` Put all your CSS and any other JavaScript files in the `client` folder. Put all your front-end assets in `client/img` folder and back-end assets in `server/data` folder. Git will ignore content in these folders and you must copy them separately to the server when you are deploying.

For lab 4, create front-end framework inside `client` folder.

Edit `server/server.js` file to add JavaScript code that implements your REST API.
